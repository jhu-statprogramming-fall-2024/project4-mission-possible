## Overview

Team: Mission Possible

Team member: Can Wang, Xiao Wu, Xindi Shan

This project investigates trends in the number of clinical trials conducted across different countries, disease types, and phases, and examines how these trends evolve over time. The goal is to leverage clinical trial data to develop a comprehensive dashboard for visualizing and analyzing these trends dynamically. The depolyed dashboard could be found at https://wangcan20.shinyapps.io/Dashboard/

## Key detailes
- Using up-to-date data from ClinicalTrials.gov using PostgreSQL AACT database
  - Including trials that were conducted in the past 10 years on top 10 most studied diseases in top 10 countries with the most number of trials
- Developing an interactive and intuitive dashboard with flexdashboard 
- Providing dynamic visualization of the trend based on:
  - Disease type
  - Trial phase  
  - Trial location
- Making prediction using LASSO model
